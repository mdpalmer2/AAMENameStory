There once was a Dog named Doug. Doug lived in Dallas with his daughter Daisy. Doug dug holes all day, and when he was done he danced to disco.

Doug's disco was really drab today. Too drab to duggie so Doug didn't do much. He went home to drool.

Doug made it home to find a pesky squirrel in his yard. Doug doesn't like squirrels. Doug glared at the squirrel with its mouth full of seeds.
